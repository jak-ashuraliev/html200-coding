    <h2>Lesson 5 Assignment</h2><br>
    <h3>Banking Application</h3><br>
    <p>Regular Challenge: Create a simple HTML site with a JavaScript file that is a bank application.</p><br>
    <p>Create a bank application.</p><br>
    <p class="indent">- The user should see a prompt so they can type which action to perform.</p><br>
    <p class="indent">- The user will have a list of 4 actions to choose from.</p><br>

    <p class="indent-2">- Enter <strong>Q</strong> to quit (immediately quits the program).</p><br>
    <p class="indent-2">- Enter <strong>W</strong> to withdraw. The user will be prompted again to enter an amount to
      withdraw. After
      withdrawing money, they should be able to type another option.</p><br>
    <p class="indent-2">- Enter <strong>D</strong> to deposit. The user will be prompted again to enter an amount to
      deposit. After
      depositing money, they should be able to type another option.</p><br>
    <p class="indent-2">- Enter <strong>B</strong> to view balance. The user will see their balance. Afterwards, they
      should be able to
      type another option.</p><br>

    <p class="indent">- The program will loop asking for input until the user enters Q.</p><br>
    <!-- <p>Extra challenges: The additional requirements below are optional. Implement them if you finish the Regular
      Challenge 1 (above) and are up for more!</p><br>

    <p class="indent">- The user should not be able to make excessive withdrawals (no negative balances).</p><br>
    <p class="indent">- The user should have a deposit cap of $50,000.</p><br>
    <p class="indent">- The user should receive a warning to protect against low balances.</p><br>
    <p class="indent">- Create an alert if the user tries to withdraw an amount that would leave them with less than
      $300 in their account, asking them to confirm if they're sure.</p><br> -->
